CODEPATH@UCI - Android Course Syllabus
===
###### This syllabus reflects the the University of California, Irvine's structure for the Android course. Some parts of this syllabus is **not representative** of the other partner universities under CodePath.org.

### Course description

This course is a quarter long project-based exploration into Android mobile app development focusing on the design and implementation of RESTful API clients. Classes meet on campus twice a week for lab and working sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building three fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course students will apply their skills, working together in small teams, to design and and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.

### Prerequisites

Students should...

- have completed an intro to object oriented programming course **or** have existing familiarity.

Students will benefit from...
- having knowledge of Java or C++. However, this is not a requirement for the course.

### Time Commitment

- **In-person class session attendance:**
    - **Changes for COVID-19**: Video lectures are released weekly for each unit on the course's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodePath-at-UCI/android-course) at 12:00pm on Thursdy PST (Pacific Standard Time) and will vary in length throughout the duration of the quarter.
    - **For Usual Circumstances:** Classes meet 2x per week for 1-2 hour sessions over the duration of the quarter.

- **Outside of class time:** Students should plan to spend 5-10 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments and their final group project.

### Attendance and Coursework Submissions

CodePath courses focus on developing student's habits and skills in order to to be successful in the tech industry. Success in industry goes beyond proficiency in technical domains; The ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills. The following policies around attendance and coursework submissions are meant to encourage professional behavior.

#### Coursework Weighting

All coursework grading and accountability is handled by CodePath. The following table outlines how each coursework section is weighted in calculating a student's final grade. See [Coursework Grading](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/grading_spring_19) for a breakdown of scores for individual coursework items.

| Weight | Section | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 50%     | Assignments     | Weekly app projects    |
| 50%     | Group Project App Milestones     | Original app project and presentation     |

#### Bonus points

A student can earn bonus points on an app assignment by completing extra app features beyond that which is indicated as required. Bonus points will only be applied within the given coursework section they are earned and won't increase the impact of a given section beyond it's designated weight. For instance, no amount of bonus points will increase the impact of the *Assignments* section beyond 50% of the final grade.

#### Coursework Submissions

- **All coursework items** are submitted through CodePath Course Portal and due by their posted deadlines.
- **Three (48 hour deadline extensions)** are allowed for the entire quarter, no questions asked, no need to request extensions. 48 hours is the maximum  allowed extension for any individual coursework item, extensions cannot be combined per coursework item.
- **Once the 3 deadline extensions have been used**, any coursework item submitted after the posted deadline will not be accepted and the student will receive a 0 for that submission.

#### Attendance
- **Changes for COVID-19**: Attendance will be measured based on each unit/week. Weekly quizzes will be created based the main topics and concepts from each unit's lab video content. Students need to score 60% or higher on the quiz to be given credit for that unit/week, otherwise they will be marked absent. The quizzes will be designed such that anyone who has seen the lab video will easily pass and get attendance credit.

- **Allowable absences:** 
  - **Changes for COVID-19**: Max of 3 absences allowed. If a student scores < 60% on a weekly quiz, they will be marked absent for that week. Submission of that unit's coursework by the deadline is still mandatory. 
  - **For Usual Circumstances**: Max of 3 times. Submission of that unit's coursework by the deadline is still mandatory. 
  
- **Perfect Attendance:** Attendance for ALL units/weeks will result in the addition of 10% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become an 80% and an 85% would become a 95%)
- **Consistent Attendance:** 
    - **Changes for COVID-19**: Passing weekly quizzes for all weeks **OR** 70% of all week of the course will result in the addition of 5% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become a 75% and an 85% would become a 90%)
    - **For Usual Circumstances**: Attendance at at least 1 session for every week **OR** 70% of all sessions of the course will result in the addition of 5% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become a 75% and an 85% would become a 90%)

#### CodePath Requirements for Course Completion

CodePath holds all professional and college students to the same high bar of quality coursework and professionalism. In order to be considered CodePath alumni and receive recognition for successful completion of the course from CodePath, **students must complete the course with a final grade of 60% or above**.

Students meeting the above requirements will:

1. Receive a (digital) CodePath certificate of completion.
1. Be considered CodePath alumni and gain access to alumni networks.
1. Gain full access to the CodePath career center and be eligible for mentorship opportunities with CodePath professional alumni.

### Reporting

#### Grade Book

### Course Structure

This courses teaches Android development in a project-based format over a 9-week period. Each week builds on the skills and knowledge from the previous week:

* **Weekly Project.** A new basic mobile app is assigned to each student as an individual project.
* **Code Review.** We will briefly review each app and provide feedback on their code.
* **Labs.** Students have the opportunity to practice pair-programming while working on app projects during class sessions once a week.
* **Online Support.** Students can post questions and get support through our Discussions System.
* **Github Based Online Learning Portal.** Students will have access to a custom learning portal with videos, code samples, and comprehensive documentation library.

- **In-Person Class Sessions:** 
    - **Changes for COVID-19**: Class sessions will be converted into weekly lecture videos to give students access to unit material at their own time.
    - **For Usual Circumstances:** Students meet in person twice a week in 2 hour sessions to complete labs, work on weekly assignment project apps and design and implement their final group project. 
- **Homework:** Each week, we will be building an Android app that helps us reinforce and apply the concepts we introduce within the course. Expect the weekly apps to take anywhere from 5-10+ hours to complete each week outside of class. These projects will range from a basic movie reviews app to a full-featured Twitter Client.
- **Group Project:** In addition to the apps assigned each week, we will also have a collaborative course-wide project. The class will be broken up into groups of 3 students each, and every group will select a larger project to scope, design and build over the course of the class. At the end of the course, we will do a _demo day_ showcasing all of these projects. Read more about the [course-wide group project](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/android_university/pages/group_project).

### Assignments

Each week, students will build an Android app in order to apply the concepts they have learned. Weekly apps will take anywhere from 5-10+ hours outside of class session times to complete. Homework assignments are due at 11:59pm local time 1 day before the first session of the following week.
